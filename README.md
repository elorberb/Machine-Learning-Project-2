# Machine-Learning-Project-2
In this project we experimented with ensemble models. We applied Condorcet's Jury Theorem to establish the reason for using ensemble models. We used the AdaBoost boosting algorithm to classify the points we sampled. Each time we used different amounts of ensembles to see if a model with more classifications would return better results.
